# Shop Admin Front End Project

This project is built with React + TailwindCss.

The user can `view all orders`, `edit` or `delete` them, `create` new ones and `generate pdfs` from those orders.

`The Authentication` part on the Back-End side is ready but due to lack of time I couldn't finish that part for the Front-End.

The project has its own instance of axios with `error handling` + `response interception`.

## Usage

```batch
npm install
```

or

```batch
yarn
```

And then

```
yarn dev
```
